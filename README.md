# Bento Template

A Flutter web portfolio template using a bento grid layout — differently-sized rectangular tiles packed tightly together, resembling a Japanese bento box.

Fork this repo, customise `content.json`, and deploy your own portfolio in under an hour. No backend required.

## Features

- **Bento grid layout** with 9 tile size variants combining width (quarter/half/full) and height (bar/card/tower)
- **Multiple tile types**: links, text, images, maps, videos, and interactive widgets
- **Remote JSON-driven content** — update your portfolio by pushing a new `content.json`, no rebuild required
- **Three-tier content cache**: in-memory → SharedPreferences → bundled asset fallback
- **6 theme flavours** (Chalk, Dusk, Espresso, Forest, Rose, Slate) with light/dark mode, persisted locally
- **Responsive design** across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **GitHub Actions deploy workflow** included — push to `main` and your site deploys automatically
- **Analytics** via Lukehog (release mode only, injected at build time — optional)

## Quick start

Click **Use this template → Create a new repository**, then follow [`SETUP.md`](./SETUP.md).

|---|---|
| [`SETUP.md`](./SETUP.md) | Fork, configure your content branch, personalise metadata, deploy |
| [`WIDGET_GUIDE.md`](./WIDGET_GUIDE.md) | Build your own interactive widgets — step-by-step with a working example |
| [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) | Architecture reference, content schema, layer rules — for LLM agents and contributors |
| [`examples/`](./examples/) | Three starter `content.json` files — developer, designer, minimal |
| [`skills/`](./skills/) | Claude Code skills for prototyping and implementing widgets with AI |

## Architecture

Clean architecture with domain, data, and presentation layers.

**State management**
- `ThemeCubit` — brightness toggle and flavour switching, persisted via SharedPreferences
- `PortfolioBloc` — drives the app loading lifecycle: `loading → loaded / error`

**Content loading**
- On cold start, `PortfolioBloc` fires `LoadPortfolio`
- `RemoteConfigRepository` reads the best available JSON from `CacheManager` instantly, then attempts a remote fetch in the background
- If the remote `version` field is newer than the cached version, the cache is updated and the new content is used
- Failures at every tier fall through gracefully — the bundled `assets/data/content.json` is always the last resort

**Dependency injection**: GetIt

**Tile rendering**: factory-based `SmartBentoTile` delegating to specialised renderers per `TileType`

## Getting started (local dev)

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```

Pass your content URL to enable remote fetching locally:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome \
  --dart-define=CONTENT_BASE_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<you>/<repo>/content/
```

## Building widgets with AI (Claude Code)

This template includes two Claude Code skills that take you from idea to working Flutter widget without leaving your editor.

**`bento-widget-preview`** — generates an interactive HTML file that renders your widget concept inside a correctly-sized bento tile. In grid mode it compares multiple visual directions side by side. When you've found the one you want, click **"Select this variant"** — the page generates the exact `AGENT_HANDOFF` spec (implementation description, config schema, scaffold command) for that design.

**`bento-widget-complete`** — reads the `AGENT_HANDOFF` and fills in the scaffolded Dart files.

**The workflow:**

```
1. Read skills/bento-widget-preview/SKILL.md
2. Generate a preview HTML  →  browser opens, compare variants
3. Click "Select this variant"  →  AGENT_HANDOFF panel updates
4. Copy and run the scaffold command shown in the panel
5. Read skills/bento-widget-complete/SKILL.md
6. Invoke bento-widget-complete  →  Dart files are implemented
7. flutter analyze  →  must pass clean
```

Both skills are in [`skills/`](./skills/). Sample prompts are in each skill's `prompts.md`.
